Below you can find a Viruscheck, which for some Reason seem to appear mailicious for 5 Antiviruses out of 71s.
this is most likely to the AI thats beeing used to anaylize the Screenshot for Number patterns, and the updater thats included for 
Program updates.
Under behavior you can exactly see whats going on, and that there is nothing sus actually going on.
